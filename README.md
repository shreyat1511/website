# YouTube Homepage Clone

A simple clone of the YouTube homepage built using **HTML** and **CSS**.  
This project focuses on replicating the layout and styling of YouTube's interface without any backend functionality.

## Features
- Recreation of the YouTube homepage layout  
- Responsive design for different screen sizes  
- Navigation bar, sidebar, and video grid structure  

## Tech Stack
- HTML5  
- CSS3 (Flexbox and Grid)


## How to Run
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/YourUsername/youtube-homepage-clone.git

---

This keeps it **short, professional, and easy to scan** — exactly what recruiters like.  

Do you want me to also make you a **one-line project description** you can paste directly into your GitHub repo summary (the little gray text under the title)?
